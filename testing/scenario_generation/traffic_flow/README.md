# Natural Traffic Flow Generation

Natural traffic flow generation for ADS testing refers to the simulation of realistic, dynamic, and diverse traffic conditions that an autonomous vehicle might encounter in real-world scenarios.

Achieving natural traffic flow in simulation is a challenging task. It requires accurately replicating the behavior of various road users, including cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and even animals. These entities need to move and interact in a way that is indistinguishable from real-world traffic.

Creating natural traffic flow for AV testing ensures that the AV can operate safely and efficiently under real-world conditions, thereby ensuring the reliability of the autonomous driving system. It also helps identify and correct potential issues in the AV system, thus significantly reducing the risks before actual road tests.
