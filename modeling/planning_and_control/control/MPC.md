# Model Predictive Control

Model Predictive Control(MPC) is an advanced control strategy that uses a model of the system to predict the system's future states and optimize the control inputs. It's highly effective in managing the dynamics of the vehicle and handling constraints, hence becoming the most popular control strategy for most ADS.
