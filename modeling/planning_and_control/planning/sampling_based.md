# Sampling-based Planning

The sampling-based planning algorithms, well-known as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), generate a set of random samples in the state space and connect them to form a path. They are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and complex environments.
